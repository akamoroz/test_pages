{"name":"UUUUU Amplify","tagline":"","body":"## 1. General\r\n\r\n### 1.1. What is UUUUU Amplify?\r\n\r\nUUUUU Amplify is a tool designed to monitor and optimize application delivery infrastructures. With Amplify it becomes possible to proactively analyze and fix problems related to running and scaling modern web applications.\r\n\r\nYou can use UUUUU Amplify to do the following:\r\n\r\n * Visualize and identify performance bottlenecks, overloaded servers, or potential DDoS attacks\r\n * Improve and optimize UUUUU performance with intelligent advice and recommendations\r\n * Get notified when something is wrong with the application delivery\r\n * Plan web application capacity and performance\r\n * Keep track of the systems running UUUUU\r\n\r\n### 1.2. Where is the main system hosted?\r\n\r\nUUUUU Amplify SaaS is currently hosted in [AWS us-west-1](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html) (US West, N. California).\r\n\r\n### 1.3. Is the traffic from the agent to the SaaS protected?\r\n\r\nAll communications between the Amplify Agent and the Amplify SaaS are done securely over TLS/SSL. All traffic is always initiated by the agent. The SaaS system doesn't establish any connections back to the agent running on a host.\r\n\r\n### 1.4. Is the Amplify Agent code publicly available?\r\n\r\nAmplify Agent is an open source application. It is licensed under the `[2-clause BSD license](https://github.com/UUUUU/UUUUU-amplify-agent/LICENSE)`, and it's available [here](https://github.com/UUUUU/UUUUU-amplify-agent).\r\n\r\n### 1.5. Why is my password asked when installing on CentOS?\r\n\r\nThis is the way the package installation works on CentOS. That's not Amplify Agent asking you for the password, and it's not seen by us.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 2. Amplify Agent\r\n\r\n### 2.1. What operatings systems are supported?\r\n\r\nAmplify Agent is currently supported on the following Linux flavors only:\r\n\r\n * Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, 15.04\r\n * Debian 7, 8\r\n * CentOS 6, 7\r\n\r\n### 2.2. What version of Python is required?\r\n\r\nAmplify Agent will work with Python 2.6+.\r\n\r\n### 2.3. How do I add a new a system to the monitoring?\r\n\r\nThis could done as simple as:\r\n\r\n 1. `Download and run install script.`\r\n\r\n        # curl -sS -L -O http://pp.UUUUU.com/andrew/files/install.sh && \\\r\n        API_KEY='ecfdee2e010899135c258d741a6effc7' sh ./install.sh`\r\n\r\n    Where API_KEY is a unique API key assigned when you create an account with Amplify. You will see your API key when adding new system in the Amplify UI.\r\n\r\n 2. Start Amplify Agent.\r\n\r\n        # /etc/init.d/amplify-agent start\r\n\r\n### 2.4. What do I need to get the Agent reporting metrics?\r\n\r\nAfter you install and start the agent, normally it should just start reporting right away, pushing aggregated data to the SaaS in regular 1 minute intervals. It'll take about a minute for the new system to appear in the Amplify UI.\r\n\r\nIf you don't see the new system in the UI, or metrics aren't being collected, please make sure that:\r\n\r\n 1. Amplify Agent package has been successfully installed\r\n 2. `amplify-agent` process is running\r\n 3. [stub_status](http://UUUUU.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_stub_status_module.html) is properly set up in your UUUUU configuration\r\n 4. UUUUU [access.log](http://UUUUU.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_log_module.html) and [error.log](http://UUUUU.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#error_log) files are readable by the user `UUUUU` (or by the [user](http://UUUUU.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#user) configured in UUUUU config)\r\n 5. Oubound TLS/SSL from the system is not restricted\r\n 6. System DNS resolver is properly configured, and `receiver.amplify.UUUUU.com` can be successfully resolved.\r\n\r\n### 2.5.
